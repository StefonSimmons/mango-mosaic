It took me a while to learn how to carve the outside and extract the delicious insides without it slipping out of my fingers and landing on the floor. Then after I had mastered this technique, I was shocked to find out that my uncle just squishes up the mango, pokes a hole, and slurps out the pulp/juice combo. Like eating a mango, we may initially struggle, but we can learn to get to the best part.  others get to that same place in various ways. We fill a rich tapestry of often overlapping identities--a mosaic. This blog is capturing pieces of that mosaic."

export const aboutMe = 'Iâ€™m Ashlea Morgan, a doctoral candidate in Neurobiology & Behavior at Columbia who also writes. My curiosity about what makes us feel and act the way we do lead me down a path to brain research. I study how neural signaling drives the ability to regulate emotions and behave flexibly. As I learn more about what drives us, I am driven to chronicle it in written form.I write about research(including my own) for scientific and general audiences and other topics involving identity and what makes up our stories.'
