export const aboutMe = 'Iâ€™m Ashlea Morgan, a doctoral candidate in Neurobiology & Behavior at Columbia who also writes. My curiosity about what makes us feel and act the way we do lead me down a path to brain research. I study how neural signaling drives the ability to regulate emotions and behave flexibly. As I learn more about what drives us, I am driven to chronicle it in written form.I write about research(including my own) for scientific and general audiences and other topics involving identity and what makes up our stories.'
